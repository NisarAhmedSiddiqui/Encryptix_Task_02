## Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
This project used the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers based on features like age, gender, class, and more. The focus was on applying various classification algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

### Data
The dataset included information on Titanic passengers, such as age, gender, fare, and whether they survived. I performed extensive feature engineering, including handling missing values and creating new features like family size.

### Models and Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Feature engineering and selection

### Results
The model was able to achieve a high level of accuracy, with a final score of 82%, by effectively utilizing both numerical and categorical features in predicting passenger survival.
